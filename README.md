two simple django project and connect them with grpc 
for running the project first clone the code
for each project which are micro_one an server_asli create a virtualenv and install req.txt . i mean each project one virtualenv.
in server_asli project run :cd in event_grpc then python server.py
run the micro_one project like normal django projects and run the url : localhost:8000/api/type_event/ 
this url uses grpc and get result from it.
